How to create a new branch branch1 copying content from master branch and after changes push to branch1 and then merge it master

Here's a full step-by-step guide to:

✅ Create a new branch (branch1) from master,
✅ Make changes,
✅ Push branch1 to remote, and
✅ Merge it back to master.

🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions
🧱 1. Make sure you're on the latest master
git checkout master
git pull origin master
🌱 2. Create a new branch branch1 from master

git checkout -b branch1
This creates branch1 and switches to it.

✏️ 3. Make your changes
Edit files as needed, then stage and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "Your message about the changes"

☁️ 4. Push branch1 to the remote

git push origin branch1
Now branch1 exists on GitHub or your remote.

🔀 5. Merge branch1 back into master
Option A: Merge via GitHub/GitLab

1)Go to the repository on GitHub
2)You'll see an option to "Compare & Pull Request" — follow that to merge branch1 into master.

Option B: Merge via Command Line

git checkout master
git pull origin master            # Ensure you're up to date
git merge branch1
git push origin master
✅ Optional Cleanup
After merging, you can delete branch1 if not needed anymore:


git branch -d branch1          # delete local branch
git push origin --delete branch1  # delete remote branch



Once you've disconnected the remote repo (e.g., via git remote remove origin)
